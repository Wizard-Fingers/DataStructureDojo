### 01 JavaScripttling

🌍 Hella World! 🚀
Welcome to the fantastic world of "Hella World!" where we embark on an exciting adventure in JavaScript! 🎉
📁 Project Structure

Our project consists of two amazing files:

1. hella-world.js: This is where the magic happens! 🪄 It contains a function named hellaWorld() that returns the epic string "hella world!". 😎
2. hella-world.test.js: This is our trusty test file, ensuring that our hellaWorld() function always returns the correct string. 🧪

🏃‍♂️ Running the Code

To witness the awesomeness, simply run the following command:

`node hella-world.js`

And voila! 🎩 The console will display the awe-inspiring message:
`hella world!`

🧪 Testing the Code

We believe in the power of testing! 💪 To make sure our code is unbreakable, we have a test file (hella-world.test.js) that puts hellaWorld() through its paces. 🏋️‍♂️
To run the tests, execute the following command:
`npm test`

And behold! 🙌 The tests will pass with flying colors:

PASS 01-JavaScriptling/hella-world.test.js
√ Returning 'hella world!' as a string (3 ms)
