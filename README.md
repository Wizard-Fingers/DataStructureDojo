This is primally for my own notes and will add working explanations regarding what I did how I reasoned it out ect. Please feel free to contribute your own or reach out to us if you want to contribute.

-how to start

1. install npm by running `npm install` in your root directory.
2. navigate to the project directory by running `cd` then the path you want to navigate to for example:
3. `cd 01-JavaScriptling/01-hella-world`

- I personally use the "write" "run" "test" method in this project that will allow me to go further than just writing code which is how I developed my projects before. In this repo you will find folders that contain a folder called "JavaScriptling" where are some of your more basic exercises with folders containing the files you will be working with.

--01-name
-01-file.js
-01-file-run.js
-01-file-test.js

if you want to make your own exercise files you can as long as you follow the same pattern.

your first file will be the place you write your data structure, and
the second file is where you will run that data structure by navigating to it in your terminal and run `npx run <filename>` then if that gives the result you wanted make a new file with a Jest Test called file.test.js and write the test following the same pattern as the other tests in the filesystem. Personally I like to run five 4 passes and one fail however as long as there is a test file there with tests that ensure your code is robust that is good enough for your application. To run your test file please run `npx jest <filename>` and you will see the results in your terminal.
